  - Test data stored in tmp/ folder to avoid technical debt
- ‚úÖ **Consensus Aggregation Pipeline**: Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold transformation
  - Fixed averaging issue where empty Pinnacle data diluted projections
  - Only averages sources with actual projections (fantasy_points_ppr > 0)
  - Proper position/team preservation from BetOnline
- ‚úÖ **Loaded Week 1 TEST projections**: 
  - 452 BetOnline player projections with positions/teams
  - 187 Pinnacle prop-based projections (positions enriched from BetOnline)
  - 406 final consensus projections in gold layer
  - Correct fantasy points (e.g., CMC at 19.5 PPR, Lamar at 22.7)

### API Development
- ‚úÖ **Created Projections API**: GET /api/projections endpoint
  - Returns consensus projections with all stats
  - Supports week, position, and limit parameters
  - Handles NaN values properly (sanitized to null)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed CORS**: Backend now allows cross-origin requests from frontend
- ‚úÖ **Created Projections Page**: Full-featured projections display
  - Week selector (1-18)
  - Position filtering (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX)
  - Sortable columns (PPR, Floor, Ceiling)
  - Confidence ratings visualization
  - Search functionality

### Infrastructure Fixes

- ‚úÖ **Fixed database connections**: Data pipeline now connects properly to Docker PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Fixed import errors**: Resolved draft-api.ts import issue
- ‚úÖ **Verified data integrity**: All projections loading with correct values

### Data Quality Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Fixed fantasy points calculation**: Prevented zero values from diluting averages
- ‚úÖ **Preserved stat projections**: Individual yards, TDs, receptions all stored
- ‚úÖ **Position/team data**: Successfully preserved from BetOnline through pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Confidence ratings**: Based on number of sources and standard deviation

## üéØ Session 4 Achievements (2025-01-04)

## üìù Notes Section

### Session Notes
_Add notes here about decisions, blockers, or important information discovered during development_

**Session 5 - Projections Data Integration** (2025-09-04)
- Discovered available projection data sources:
  - BetOnline: Full player projections with all stat categories + alternate lines for floor/ceiling
  - Pinnacle: Sharp book prop lines with implied probabilities
  - FantasyPros: Third-party fantasy projections for imputation when props unavailable
  - ESPN: Platform projections for league-specific context
- Data format: Parquet files with weekly projections
- Key insights:
  - Props typically available Tuesday before games (limits waiver wire help)
  - Sharp books (BOL/Pinnacle) provide "true" point estimates
  - Alternate lines enable floor/ceiling calculations
  - Fantasy projections (FP/ESPN) used for imputation when no props
  - Player/Position/Team combo as primary key for data structure
- Technical approach:
  - Migrate from pandas to polars for better performance
  - Single API call to fetch all projection data
  - Store in PostgreSQL with comprehensive stat columns

### Known Issues

1. **PostgreSQL Connection Conflict** (Session 5)
   - Local PostgreSQL instance conflicts with Docker PostgreSQL on port 5432
   - Docker container uses POSTGRES_USER=app_user but may not be accessible from host
   - Workaround: Run data pipeline inside Docker or use Docker network
   - Alternative: Stop local PostgreSQL before running: `brew services stop postgresql`

2. **Registration Endpoint** (STILL BROKEN - Session 5)
   - Returns 500 error "registration failed" for all new registrations
   - Root cause: Database insertion failing after interface changes
   - Attempted fixes:
     - Added Create method to UserRepository interface ‚úÖ
     - Removed fragile type assertion in auth service ‚úÖ
     - Still failing at database insert (needs further debugging)
   - Workaround: Login endpoint works correctly with existing users
   - Last working: 20:16:50, Started failing: 20:19:01

2. **Temporarily Disabled Services** (TO RE-ENABLE)
   - credentials_service.go.disabled
   - league_service.go.disabled
   - league.go.disabled (handler)
   - Need to implement missing models and repositories

3. **Redis Not Configured** 
   - Shows as "not configured" in health check
   - Redis container is running but not connected to backend

4. **Analytics Service Migration** (PENDING)
   - Need to create new PostgreSQL-based analytics client
   - Current DuckDB code moved to internal/analytics.bak/
   - Python will handle all transformations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Standardized on uv for Python** (2025-09-04 - Session 5)
   - All Python dependencies managed via uv, not pip/pip3
   - Consistent across all environments
   - Faster and more reliable than pip

2. **Polars for Data Processing** (2025-09-04 - Session 5)  
   - Replaced pandas with polars for projections pipeline
   - Better performance for large datasets
   - More predictable NULL handling

3. **Removed DuckDB from Architecture** (2025-01-03)
   - Issue: DuckDB Go driver requires Go 1.24+ but Docker containers have Go 1.23
   - Solution: Use PostgreSQL as single database with bronze/silver/gold schemas
   - Python handles all data transformation logic
   - Simplifies architecture and resolves compilation issues

2. **Using pre-calculated fantasy points from nflverse** (2025-01-02)
   - nflverse data includes fantasy_points_ppr and fantasy_points columns
   - Hybrid approach: use pre-calculated, maintain verification capability

3. **ESPN Cookie Authentication** (2025-01-02)
   - Using SWID and espn_s2 cookies for private league access
   - Cookies obtained from browser when logged into league

### Performance Metrics

1. **Backend Response Times** (2025-01-03)
   - Health endpoint: ~5ms
   - Login endpoint: ~29ms
   - Registration endpoint: ~47ms (currently failing)

### Validation Results (2025-01-03)

‚úÖ **Working Endpoints:**
- GET `/health` - System health check
- GET `/` - API info  
- POST `/api/auth/login` - Returns proper error for invalid credentials

‚ö†Ô∏è **Endpoints with Issues:**
- POST `/api/auth/register` - 500 error (schema mismatch)

‚úÖ **Infrastructure:**
- All Docker containers running (postgres, redis, backend, frontend, pipeline)
- PostgreSQL connection working
- Backend compiles with Go 1.21 (fixed Go 1.24 dependency issue)
