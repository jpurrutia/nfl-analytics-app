## 📝 Notes Section

### Session Notes
_Add notes here about decisions, blockers, or important information discovered during development_

### Known Issues

1. **Registration Endpoint** (NEEDS FIX)
   - Returns 500 error due to database schema mismatch
   - Columns added but still having issues with user creation
   - Login endpoint works correctly

2. **Temporarily Disabled Services** (TO RE-ENABLE)
   - credentials_service.go.disabled
   - league_service.go.disabled
   - league.go.disabled (handler)
   - Need to implement missing models and repositories

3. **Redis Not Configured** 
   - Shows as "not configured" in health check
   - Redis container is running but not connected to backend

4. **Analytics Service Migration** (PENDING)
   - Need to create new PostgreSQL-based analytics client
   - Current DuckDB code moved to internal/analytics.bak/
   - Python will handle all transformations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Removed DuckDB from Architecture** (2025-01-03)
   - Issue: DuckDB Go driver requires Go 1.24+ but Docker containers have Go 1.23
   - Solution: Use PostgreSQL as single database with bronze/silver/gold schemas
   - Python handles all data transformation logic
   - Simplifies architecture and resolves compilation issues

2. **Using pre-calculated fantasy points from nflverse** (2025-01-02)
   - nflverse data includes fantasy_points_ppr and fantasy_points columns
   - Hybrid approach: use pre-calculated, maintain verification capability

3. **ESPN Cookie Authentication** (2025-01-02)
   - Using SWID and espn_s2 cookies for private league access
